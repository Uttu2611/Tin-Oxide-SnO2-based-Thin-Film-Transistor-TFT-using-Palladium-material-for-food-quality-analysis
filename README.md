## Introduction
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Field Effect Transistors (FETs) play a crucial role in modern electronic devices, forming the foundation of integrated circuits. Simulation of Organic FETs (OFETs) facilitates the analysis and optimization of important parameters like on-current, threshold voltage, and on/off ratio, which are very important to improve the performance of thin-film transistors (TFTs). Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) software allows simulations of semiconductor behavior with high accuracy, and therefore they provide a useful hint before physical realization.

Materials such as Titanium Dioxide (TiO₂) and Amorphous Indium-Gallium-Zinc Oxide (a-IGZO) are extensively studied for TFT deployment, yet stability under different biasing conditions remains a problem. To extend beyond such limitations, Palladium-assisted MOSFET architectures have been reported for applications in sensing gases. Here, Silicon-based MOSFET using SiO₂ as the dielectric with Palladium above the channel is proposed for toxic gas detection related to food decay. The back-gate structure improves carrier modulation and sensitivity to response. TCAD simulations analyze the device's output and transfer characteristics, which testifies to its potential to be an efficient gas sensor for food safety monitoring.

Figure 1 shows the cross-sectional structure of the presented Thin Film Transistor (TFT) gas sensor, with the structural details tabulated in Table 1. The device is based on a back-gated Field Effect Transistor (FET) structure, wherein the gate is realized by a heavily doped p-type silicon substrate, and metal electrodes are used to demarcate the source and drain regions. The silicon nanowire channel offers a high surface-to-volume ratio, which improves the overall sensing sensitivity.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A Palladium (Pd) layer is deposited on top of the silicon channel, serving as the gas-sensing material because of its high catalytic activity. Upon exposure to hydrogen-based or other poisonous gases, the Palladium layer adsorbs the gas molecules, resulting in a change in its work function. This change alters the drain current, facilitating gas detection through quantifiable electrical response.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The output behavior of the device was examined for different gate work functions to investigate their effect on current variation and sensitivity. In the absence of the Palladium layer, the device exhibits merely baseline current changes and fails to detect gases. By including the Pd layer, the transistor can successfully detect and measure toxic gases and is well suited for food safety and environmental monitoring applications.
